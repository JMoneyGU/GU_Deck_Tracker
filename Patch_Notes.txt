These are the patch notes; basically what has changed for each version. Most recent changes will be at the top!


v1.2:
 -Functionality Changes:
   --Number of cards remaining in deck is now displayed
   --Percent chance to draw cards is now displayed
   --Shuffling tracking removed. Note that any cards shuffled into your deck will not be displayed, or correctly update the number of cards in deck/%'s to draw.
    (This was done because the feature was horribly inconsistent and causing more problems than it was worth. This is planned to be reimplemented in a later version.)
   
 -UI Changes:
  --Logo added in the top left-hand corner




v1.1:
 -UI Changes:
 --Buttons look better
 --Nightmode Added
 --Transparency Added
 
 -Functionality Changes:
 --Paths will automatically fill in <USER>. This means that you no longer need to update the code unless you change where the local folder is.
