# Gods Unchained Deck Tracker

This Python program will allow you to know what cards are left in your deck!
*Note that this is still under construction. I am planning to add features (such as saving decks) and working out bugs (i.e. cards shuffled into your opponnent's deck).*


**Known Bugs**

- Cards shuffled into your opponents deck will appear as if they were shuffled into your deck instead
- Choose One Cards (Like Canopy Barage) will shuffle 
- Weapons sometimes go into your deck when played





# Setup Guide

**1. Download the .zip folder and extract the files**
- I have mine on my Desktop so I don't lose track of it, but you can really put it wherever you want

**2. Edit the Python file**
- There are 3 things that you need to change (the 3 file paths)
- 1. logFileName
- 2. tempFileName
- 3. deckFileName

If you extracted the folder onto your desktop, you should only need to change the <USER> to your username; everything else should work (for now). If it doesn't, you need the correct paths to the files mentioned.

- (4. Optional) defaultFontSize: If you want the font to start bigger/smaller when you launch the app, you can change this

**3. Start the application**

 - Seems simple enough, but you need to start it for it to work
 
 **4. Play a game against the AI with the deck you want to use**
 
 - Feel free to concede as soon as you are able. This step is required in order to log your deck because log files only have your deck against AI
 
 **5. Click on Create Deck**
 
  - This should load the application with your deck
 
 **6. Play games!**
 
 -  The deck tracker should automatically refresh whenever you start a new game!
 
 
 ***Note: You need to repeat steps 4 and 5 whenever you change decks. Also, you can click on "Load Deck" instead of doing steps 4 and 5 if you end the program and restart it later (as long as you are using the same deck.***
