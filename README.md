# Gods Unchained Deck Tracker

This Python program will allow you to know what cards are left in your deck!
*Note that this is still under construction. I am planning to add features (such as saving decks) and working out bugs (i.e. cards shuffled into your opponnent's deck).*


**Known Bugs**

-Cards shuffled into your opponents deck will appear as if they were shuffled into your deck instead





# Setup Guide

**1. Download the .zip folder and extract the files**
- I have mine on my Desktop so I don't lose track of it, but you can really put it wherever you want

**2. Edit the Python file**
- There are 3 things that you need to change (the 3 file paths)
- 1. logFileName
- 2. tempFileName
- 3. deckFileName

If you extracted the folder onto your desktop, you should only need to change the <USER> to your username; everything else should work (for now). If it doesn't, you need the correct paths to the files mentioned.

- (4. Optional) defaultFontSize: If you want the font to start bigger/smaller when you launch the app, you can change this
