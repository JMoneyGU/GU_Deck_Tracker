# Gods Unchained Deck Tracker

This Python program will allow you to know what cards are left in your deck!
*Note that this is still under construction. I am planning to add features (such as saving decks and reimplementing the shuffling feature) and working out bugs.*







# Setup Guide

**0. Install Python (if you don't have it already)**
 - Go to https://python.org/downloads/
 - You need to do this if you do not have python version 3.X

**1. Download the .zip folder and extract the files**
- I have mine on my Desktop so I don't lose track of it, but you can really put it wherever you want

**2. Edit the Python file (if you want, but really not required)**
-In the unlikely case where the paths are incorrect, you may need to manually change them; however this should rarely if ever be an issue.

-You can also edit various variables to suit your preferences:
 -- 1. defaultFontSize: If you want the font to start bigger/smaller when you launch the app, you can change this
 -- 3. alphaLevel: Change to a value between 0 and 1 to make the app launch with more or less transparancy (0 is completely invisible, 1 is fully visible).
 -- 2. nightMode: Change to "True" if you want to launch the program in night mode instead of day mode


**3. Start the application**

 - Seems simple enough, but you need to start it for it to work
 
 **4. Play a game against the AI with the deck you want to use**
 
 - Feel free to concede as soon as you are able. This step is required in order to log your deck because log files only have your deck against AI
 - Yes I know this is annoying, but talk to GU about their log files, not me.
 
 **5. Click on Create Deck**
 
  - This should load the application with your deck
 
 **6. Play games!**
 
 -  The deck tracker should automatically refresh whenever you start a new game!
 
 
 ***Note: You need to repeat steps 4 and 5 whenever you change decks. Also, you can click on "Load Deck" instead of doing steps 4 and 5 if you end the program and restart it later (as long as you are using the same deck as before).***

 ***PLEASE DO NOT FEEL OBLIGATED TO DONATE***. This deck tracker is **free** and open-source, and it will continue to be as such. Please only donate if you have nothing better to spend your money on. If you do donate, thank you very much! It helps me know that people value this, and that I should continue to work on it.
